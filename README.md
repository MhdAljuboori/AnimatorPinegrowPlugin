When you activate an animation action from the `WP` panel, you'll see there are some fields you have to fill them out

* *Animation type* is the animation that will run when the trigger happend.
* *Animation to remove* is the animation that will removed from the element when the trigger happend.

The second is working only if you choosed scroll as your trigger.

* *Scroll direction* means if the user is scrolling down or up.
* *Scroll target* when the scroll event happend which element you want to effect.
* *Scroll offset* the offset between the element and the top.

Quick Tutorial
==============

* Setting the trigger on load and adding animation type like `fadeInDown`, when the document is ready you'll see the element you've selected appear (top to down).
* Setting the trigger on hover, will effect on element the same way load effect but when you hover the element.
* Settign the trigger on click, the effect will happend when the user click the element, like setting `shake` animation to the button.
* By setting the trigger on scroll, you'll have to full the second section **Scroll direction**, **Scroll target** and **Scroll offset**, so if you want to show the navbar after the user scroll down 500px, you have to add the animation to your `hero-unit`/`jumbotron`, select scroll as a trigger, setting the animation type (`slideInDown`) then by going to the second section you'll set, the scroll direction (`Down`) the scroll target which is your navbar (`.navbar`) finally the offset (`-500px`).
